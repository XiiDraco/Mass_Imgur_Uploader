# Mass_Imgur_Uploader
Small application to upload multiple files to Imgur anonymously.

## Summary
Mass Imgur Uploader is a small application that takes multiple images and uploads them to Imgur. After the images are uploaded the program gives back their upload links in the form of a list. The program has the option to invert the color of the images and to change the contrast of the inverted images. You can also choose to either browse for images on your computer or to drag and drop them into the input box.

## Functionality
The program currently has limited functionality but includes the following:

* Multiple image uploads at once
* Drag and drop
* Inversion of image
* Adjustable contrast of inverted image

# Download
Unfortunately I can't really do much about Window's security complaining about it not being fully signed, yet, but the code is out in the open so it's pretty transparent. You can download it [here](https://github.com/XiiDraco/Mass_Imgur_Uploader/releases): 

## Why did I make this?
I was watching the streamer Gladd while he was helping during the efforts of the corridors of time puzzle in Destiny 2. I made this to speed up the amount of time it took for him to copy and past data between the sheets, his screenshots, etcetera. It was almost painful to watch. :)
